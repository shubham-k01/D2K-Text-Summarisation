It is important to have a healthcare workforce which represents the tapestry of our communities as it relates to race/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, immigration status, physical disability status, and socioeconomic level to render the best possible care to our diverse patient populations. METHODS: We explore efforts by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME), the Institute of Medicine (IOM), and other medical organizations to improve diversity and inclusion in medicine. CONCLUSION: Finally, we report on best practices, frameworks, and strategies which have been utilized to improve diversity and inclusion in healthcare.'}, {'PMID': '31550922', 'Title': 'Artificial intelligence in healthcare: An essential guide for health leaders.', 'Abstract': 'Artificial Intelligence (AI) is evolving rapidly in healthcare, and various AI applications have been developed to solve some of the most pressing problems that health organizations currently face. It is crucial for health leaders to understand the state of AI technologies and the ways that such technologies can be used to improve the efficiency, safety, and access of health services, achieving value-based care. This article provides a guide to understand the fundamentals of AI technologies (ie, machine learning, natural language processing, and AI voice assistants) as well as their proper use in healthcare. It also provides practical recommendations to help decision-makers develop an AI strategy that can support their digital healthcare transformation.'}, {'PMID': '35670616', 'Title': 'Healthcare Compensation Plans: Current Challenges and Novel Approaches.', 'Abstract': \"The US healthcare sector differs from others, particularly with regard to how its workforce is compensated. In healthcare's third-party payer system, the consumer (i.e., the patient) typically is not the one paying for the service. Moreover, the payment for a given service is negotiated by the provider and the third-party payer before the patient ever seeks care-and the payment for the same service may differ among payers and patients. To further complicate matters, myriad overlapping federal, state, and local statutes and regulations govern how providers interact with patients and each other. The challenges with compensating physicians have been amplified by the healthcare workforce shortage that was looming even before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. In light of these various forces in the healthcare industry, this article reviews the current ways healthcare providers are compensated and the challenges with those compensation plans. Potential approaches to remedy those challenges are described, both broadly and with specific real-world examples related to primary care and surgical specialties. Lessons learned from these approaches include ways that healthcare organizations may measure the success of a compensation plan.\"}, {'PMID': '31732680', 'Title': \"What does 'quality' add? Towards an ethics of healthcare improvement.\", 'Abstract': \"In this paper, we argue that there are important ethical questions about healthcare improvement which are underexplored. We start by drawing on two existing literatures: first, the prevailing, primarily governance-oriented, application of ethics to healthcare 'quality improvement' (QI), and second, the application of QI to healthcare ethics. We show that these are insufficient for ethical analysis of healthcare improvement. In pursuit of a broader agenda for an ethics of healthcare improvement, we note that QI and ethics can, in some respects, be treated as closely related concerns and not simply as externally related agendas. To support our argument, we explore the gap between 'quality' and 'ethics' discourses and ask about the possible differences between 'good quality healthcare' and 'good healthcare'. We suggest that the word 'quality' both adds to and subtracts from the idea of 'good healthcare', and in particular that the technicist inflection of quality discourses needs to be set in the context of broader conceptualisations of healthcare improvement. We introduce the distinction between quality as a measurable property and quality as an evaluative judgement, suggesting that a core, but neglected, question for an ethics of healthcare improvement is striking the balance between these two conceptions of quality.\"}, {'PMID': '36495531', 'Title': 'Healthcare Reform Is Not Yet on the Horizon.', 'Abstract': 'Healthcare reform is on everyone\\'s lips these days. persistent calls for a \"difference\" and \"change\" are becoming louder.

The healthcare sector both contributes to climate change and is vulnerable to its impacts. Healthcare's greenhouse gas emissions are primarily derived from its supply chain: the production, transport, and disposal of goods. METHODS: Document analysis was used to investigate the workplace policies of one large, Western Canadian healthcare organization. Policies that indicated how employees should engage with resources were reviewed through the lens of environmentally responsible practice and planetary health. Content and thematic analysis were applied. RESULTS: Four themes were identified: procurement of resources, resource utilization, resource conservation, and waste management. CONCLUSION: There was little evidence of environmental or climate impact consideration within the organization's policies. IMPLICATIONS: Healthcare organizations could benefit from integrating a planetary health perspective into their policies to deliver healthcare that considers the health and safety of both humans and the climate.\"}, {'PMID': '33386675', 'Title': \"A systematic review of healthcare professionals' core competency instruments.\", 'Abstract': \"While technical and profession-specific competencies are paramount in the delivery of healthcare services, the cross-cutting core competencies of healthcare professionals play an important role in healthcare transformation, innovation, and the integration of roles. This systematic review describes the characteristics and psychometric properties of existing instruments for assessing healthcare professionals' core competencies in clinical settings. It was guided by the JBI methodology and used the COSMIN checklist (Mokkink et al., User manual, 2018, 78, 1) to evaluate the methodological quality of the included studies. A database search (CINAHL, Scopus, and PubMed) and additional manual search were undertaken for peer-reviewed papers with abstracts, published in English between 2008 and 2019. The search identified nine studies that were included in the synthesis demonstrating core competencies in professionalism, ethical and legal issues, research and evidence-based practice, personal and professional development, teamwork and collaboration, leadership and management, and patient-centered care. Few instruments addressed competencies in quality improvement, safety, communication, or health information technology. The findings demonstrate the reviewed tools' validity and reliability and pave the way for a comprehensive evaluation and assessment of core competencies into clinical practice.\"}, {'PMID': '34232148', 'Title': 'What can a learning healthcare system teach us about improving outcomes?', 'Abstract': 'PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review describes the learning healthcare system paradigm, recent examples, and future directions. Patients, clinicians, and health systems frequently encounter decisions between available treatments, technologies, and healthcare delivery methods with little or no evidence about the comparative effectiveness and safety of the available options. Learning healthcare systems endeavor to recognize such knowledge gaps, integrate comparative effectiveness research - including clinical trials - into clinical care to address the knowledge gaps, and seamlessly implement the results into practice to improve care and patient outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies comparing the effectiveness of diagnostic tests and treatments, using information technology to identify patients likely to experience an outcome or benefit from an intervention, and evaluating models of healthcare delivery have demonstrated how a learning healthcare system approach can reduce arbitrary variation in care, decrease cost, and improve patient outcomes. SUMMARY: Learning healthcare systems have the potential to answer questions of importance to patients, clinicians, and health system leaders, improve efficiency of healthcare delivery, and improve patient outcomes. Achieving this goal will require realignment of the culture around clinical care, institutional and federal investment, expanded stakeholder engagement, tailored ethical and regulatory guidance, and methodologic advances in information technology and biostatistics.'}, {'PMID': '33995804', 'Title': 'Challenges in healthcare financing for surgery in sub-Saharan Africa.', 'Abstract': \"One-third of the global burden of disease is attributed to surgical conditions yet, 5 billion people globally, lack access to surgery. The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery, Obstetrics, and Anesthesia (LCOGS) published guidelines for improving access by reducing catastrophic health expenditures (CHEs) by 2030. This is especially important in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where 90% of the extreme poor reside. In this paper, we provide a narrative review of four studies on CHEs for surgical care in SSA published since 2015. We discuss healthcare financing in the countries and summarize the authors' key findings of out-of-pocket payments (OOP) and CHEs. Briefly, the studies enrolled 130 to 300 patients and collected direct OOPs via chart review of health costs or patient interviews. Indirect costs were calculated from lost wages and transportation costs. CHEs were defined as health costs exceeding 10% of the GDP per capita or the household income. Despite healthcare being reported as free in all studies, 60%-90% of surgical patients had CHEs with all costs considered. OOPs persists for medicines and anesthesia that should be covered under any health insurance scheme. In some cases, indirect costs associated with transportation and wages were major drivers of CHEs for surgery. Without addressing these gaps in coverage, more people will risk impoverishment in seeking surgical care in SSA.\"}, {'PMID': '36194519', 'Title': 'Achieving sustainable healthcare through deprescribing.', 'Abstract': ''}]\n"
